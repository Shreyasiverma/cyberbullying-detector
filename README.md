# cyberbullying-detector
A machine learning based Cyberbullying Detection project using NLP and Logistic Regression to identify abusive or harmful texts.



🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to detect cyberbullying in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Machine Learning classification model (Logistic Regression).
It identifies whether a piece of text contains:

Harassment

Abusive language

Toxic or harmful content

Or is safe and non-bullying

🧠 What This System Does

✔ Cleans and preprocesses text
✔ Removes noise (stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
✔ Converts text into vectors using TF-IDF
✔ Classifies comments using Logistic Regression
✔ Outputs whether a message is Cyberbullying / Not Cyberbullying
